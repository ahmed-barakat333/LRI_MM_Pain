This folder contains data and code used to analyse and visualize protein-protein interactions between MM cell types and sensory neurons. 
This folder has the following subfolders:

- Cell_type_ligands: Data and code used to visualize ligands of each MM cell type that interact with sensory neuron receptors, and annotate each ligand with "biological process" and "molecular function" [Uniprot keywords](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/UniProtKeywords.html).
  
- Chord_diagram: Visualize of some of the interactions between ligands of MM - plasma cells (PCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with sensory neuron receptors. This based on code and functions from [circlize](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/) R package
  
- Communication_score: a quantitative analysis of interaction strength between MM cell ligands (PCs and BMSCs) and sensory neuron receptors.
