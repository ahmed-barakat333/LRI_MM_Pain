# Network analysis

This folder contains the data and code used to construct a signaling network of MM PCs and BMSCs using [CARNIVAL](https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/). In particular, the GitHub [transcriptutorial](https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial/tree/c03cf2c2f52264db290346d1f9c33c5a242b5360) as of Nov 21 2022 was followed. As advised in the tutorial, the R scripts from `transcriptutorial/scripts/` were downloaded locally in the `scripts` folder of each dataset's analysis directory and loaded in the respective analysis R script. 

Please note, to run this code, a Gurobi solver is needed (https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/).
